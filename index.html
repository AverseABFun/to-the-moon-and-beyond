          You wake up every morning to your alarm. You jump out of bed, brushing
          the ceiling as you duck so you don't hit it. You've made that mistake
          many times before. You land directly by your alarm and slap it to turn
          it off and activate the AWUAR(Automatic Wake Up And Refresh) routine.
          You hug your arms to your sides as the tube comes down around your
          body to shoot you through at Mach 0.5 to bring you to the main
          complex, Hecate-1, from your personal pod, Thoth-5. You yawn as you
          see the familiar lunar landscape zoom by beneath the transparent pod.
          As you enter a tight bend, you get turned upwards and for a brief,
          breathtaking moment, you can see Earth begining to emerge from the
          horizon. You then enter the complex and GRANNI(the Grandiloquent
          Refresher And Neural Network Interface) begins taking care of you.<br />
          <code>"Any night fantasies last night?"</code> questions GRANNI.<br />
          You roll your eyes. GRANNI always likes using grandious words.<br />
          <i>"No, GRANNI, I had no DREAMS last night."</i> you respond.<br />
          GRANNI continues the AWUAR routine and you see your father entering
          the complex to the right and see Emily entering to the left. You can't
          see it, but further past them both are remaining members of the
          settlement: Jack, Brien, Reina, each of their parents(Reina and Brien
          are twins, by the way) and your mother. You soon finish AWUAR and get
          popped out into the main room of Hecate-1 and you saunter over to the
          breakfast room. You see what the ACR(Automatic Cooking Robot) has
          made, and as you make your way to the front of the line, the ACR asks,
          <code>"What shall it be, Leo?"</code><br />
          <br />
          <button class="change-page" data-to-page="eggs">Eggs</button
          ><button class="change-page" data-to-page="breakfast-sandwich">
            Breakfast Sandwich</button
          ><button class="change-page" data-to-page="cereal">Cereal</button>
        </p>
        <p id="eggs" class="page">
          You say to the ACR, <i>"Eggs, please."</i><br />
          The ACR responds, <code>"Anything else?"</code><br />
          <i>"No, thank you."</i><br />
          You make your way to the breakfast table, beginning to eat as you go,
          because the ACR is <i>just so good at cooking</i> and you are hungry.
          You notice there is an odd metalic aftertaste today. You decide to ask
          the ACR about it later. You reach the table and sit down in your usual
          spot, next to Reina. You talk with the others as they get here. Jack
          had a weird dream where he was the "quarter-back" in a odd Earth sport
          called "foot-ball". Brien had no dreams. Reina had a dream where she
          was all alone on the surface of Luna with the settlement out of sight.
          You see that Reina also got the eggs. After everyone except for your
          parents(their always late for whatever reason) arrived, Reina says,
          <span class="sick">"Urgh. My stomach hurts."</span> before bolting for
          the bathroom with her hand clenched to her mouth. You hear sounds of
          retching coming from the other room. Reina's parents quickly run over
          to help her. A couple of minutes later, you start to feel sick too.
          You only have time to quickly say,
          <span class="sick">"Uh-oh"</span> before you run to the bathroom and
          barf your guts out. Even after you empty your stomach, you continue
          dry heaving. Eventually you pass out and wake up a couple days later
          feeling marginally better in the medbay with a sore throat. You can
          see that you were hooked up to an IV and you glance around, seeing
          that your mother is asleep, sitting on a chair across from you. A
          small robot rolls up to you carrying a glass of some liquid and says,
          <code
            >Good to see you up. Drink this, it should help with your sore
            throat.</code
          ><br />You accept the glass and drink it. After swallowing it, you
          give the glass back to the robot. Your mother wakes up and says,
          <i
            >"Thank heavens you're alive! We were so afraid you wouldn't make
            it!"</i
          ><br />
          <i>"What happened?"</i><br />
          <i
            >"Some kind of severe stomach bug. We've talked to Earth Command and
            they are investigating."</i
          ><br />
          <i>"What about Reina? I don't see her in here."</i><br />
          It feels like the rooms temperature drops a couple of degrees. Your
          mother looks at the floor and the smile freezes on her face.<br />
          <i>"We tried our best. But... Reina didn't make it"</i><br />
          You freeze. What? Reina... Gone? You can't believe it.<br />
          For years after, you think of Reina and feel sad. You never fully
          recover from the trauma and you live your life, trying to forget about
          it.<br /><br />
          <span
            class="ending"
            data-ending-title="Reina gone ending"
            data-ending-feeling="bad"
          ></span>
        </p>
        <p id="breakfast-sandwich" class="page">
          You tell the ACR, <i>"A breakfast sandwich, please."</i><br>
          The ACR responds, <code>"Are you sure you don't want the eggs? They're freshly cooked straight from the supply ship."</code>
          <i>"No, I'm sure."</i><br>
          <code>"Alright. Anything else?"</code>
          <i>"No, that's alright."</i>
          You make your way to the breakfast table, taking large bites of the sandwich as you go, because the ACR is <i>so good</i> at cooking.
