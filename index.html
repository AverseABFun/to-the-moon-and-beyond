          You wake up every morning to your alarm. You jump out of bed, brushing
          the ceiling as you duck so you don't hit it. You've made that mistake
          many times before. You land directly by your alarm and slap it to turn
          it off and activate the AWUAR(Automatic Wake Up And Refresh) routine.
          You hug your arms to your sides as the tube comes down around your
          body to shoot you through at Mach 0.5 to bring you to the main
          complex, Hecate-1, from your personal pod, Thoth-5. You yawn as you
          see the familiar lunar landscape zoom by beneath the transparent pod.
          As you enter a tight bend, you get turned upwards and for a brief,
          breathtaking moment, you can see Earth begining to emerge from the
          horizon. You then enter the complex and GRANNI(the Grandiloquent
          Refresher And Neural Network Interface) begins taking care of you.<br />
          <code>"Any night fantasies last night?"</code> questions GRANNI.<br />
          You roll your eyes. GRANNI always likes using grandious words.<br />
          <i>"No, GRANNI, I had no DREAMS last night."</i> you respond.<br />
          GRANNI continues the AWUAR routine and you see your father entering
          the complex to the right and see Emily entering to the left. You can't
          see it, but further past them both are remaining members of the
          settlement: Jack, Brien, Reina, each of their parents(Reina and Brien
          are twins, by the way) and your mother. You soon finish AWUAR and get
          popped out into the main room of Hecate-1 and you saunter over to the
          breakfast room. You see what the ACR(Automatic Cooking Robot) has
          made, and as you make your way to the front of the line, the ACR asks,
          <code>"What shall it be, Leo?"</code><br />

          You say to the ACR, <i>"Eggs, please."</i><br />
          The ACR responds, <code>"Anything else?"</code><br />
          <i>"No, thank you."</i><br />
          You make your way to the breakfast table, beginning to eat as you go,
          because the ACR is <i>just so good at cooking</i> and you are hungry.
          You notice there is an odd metalic aftertaste today. You decide to ask
          the ACR about it later.

          You see that Reina also got the eggs. After everyone except for your
          parents(their always late for whatever reason) arrived, Reina says,
          <span class="sick">"Urgh. My stomach hurts."</span> before bolting for
          the bathroom with her hand clenched to her mouth. You hear sounds of
          retching coming from the other room. Reina's parents quickly run over
          to help her. A couple of minutes later, you start to feel sick too.
          You only have time to quickly say,
          <span class="sick">"Uh-oh"</span> before you run to the bathroom and
          barf your guts out. Even after you empty your stomach, you continue
          dry heaving. Eventually you pass out and wake up a couple days later
          feeling marginally better in the medbay with a sore throat. You can
          see that you were hooked up to an IV and you glance around, seeing
          that your mother is asleep, sitting on a chair across from you. A
          small robot rolls up to you carrying a glass of some liquid and says,
          <code
            >Good to see you up. Drink this, it should help with your sore
            throat.</code
          ><br />You accept the glass and drink it. After swallowing it, you
          give the glass back to the robot. Your mother wakes up and says,
          <i
            >"Thank heavens you're alive! We were so afraid you wouldn't make
            it!"</i

          <i>"What happened?"</i><br />
          <i
            >"Some kind of severe stomach bug. We've talked to Earth Command and
            they are investigating."</i
          ><br />
          <i>"What about Reina? I don't see her in here."</i><br />
          It feels like the rooms temperature drops a couple of degrees. Your
          mother looks at the floor and the smile freezes on her face.<br />
          <i>"We tried our best. But... Reina didn't make it"</i><br />
          You freeze. What? Reina... Gone? You can't believe it.<br />
          For years after, you think of Reina and feel sad. You never fully
          recover from the trauma and you live your life, trying to forget about
          it.<br /><br />

        <p id="breakfast-sandwich" class="page">
          You tell the ACR, <i>"A breakfast sandwich, please."</i><br />

          The ACR responds,
          <code
            >"Are you sure you don't want the eggs? They're freshly cooked
            straight from the supply ship."</code

          <i>"No, I'm sure."</i><br />
          <code>"Alright. Anything else?"</code>
          <i>"No, that's alright."</i>
          You make your way to the breakfast table, taking large bites of the
          sandwich as you go, because the ACR is <i>so good</i> at cooking.
          <span id="main-segment-for-non-eggs">
            <span class="include" data-include="#dream-segment"></span> You then
            see the Reina got the eggs. Soon, she says
            <span class="sick">"Urgh. My stomach hurts."</span> before bolting
            for the bathroom with her hand clenched to her mouth. You hear
            sounds of retching coming from the other room. You stare down at
            your sandwich. Suddenly, you don't feel hungry anymore. You state
            that you are going to help her before making your way to the medbay
            and grabbing a mask, hand sanitizer, a bodily fluid cleanup kit, a
            automatic bacteria tester, and antibiotics. You then go over to the
            bathroom/washroom, see that she is dry heaving, and carefully
            cleanup her and around her before using a generous amount of hand
            sanitizer and testing her vomit for bacteria. You find it
            <i>teeming</i> with a kind of bacteria called "Bacillus Languor" and
            immedatly adminsiter antibiotics before rubbing her back and
            comforting her. By that point the adults have arrived and you tell
            them all of your findings, including that Basicillus Languor was the
            cause. When you say that, they glance at each other before grabbing
            masks, throughly washing their hands, and picking her up and
            bringing her to the medbay. They then hook her up to an IV with both
            intervenous antibiotics and water plus nutrients to keep her alive.
            You see the other kids trying to walk in and getting stopped with
            masks and hand sanitizer. You use hand sanitizer again to make sure
            your safe.<br />
            You have to decide now, do you want to ask about Bacillus Languor?
            You could be able to help if you ask, but it also might interfere
            with her treatment and you don't want that.<br />

          You work up the courage to ask, "What is Bacillus Languor?"<br />
          No one spares a glance in your direction, except for your mother. She
          sits down by you and says, "Bacillus Languor is a horrible disease. I
          wish I could tell you more, but I have to keep helping Reina. Why
          don't you go to Thoth-5 and ask GRANNI about it." You say, "Alright."

          You decide against asking about it as you don't want to interfere with
          Reina's treatment. You quietly slip away back to Thoth-5 and decide to
          ask GRANNI.
          <br />

          <button class="change-page" data-to-page="ask-granni-about-languor">

        <p id="ask-granni-about-languor" class="page">
          As you zoom through the transparent tube, you stare down at the lunar
          landscape, unfeeling. You hope against hope that Reina will be
          okay.<br />
          You soon reach Thoth-5 and ask GRANNI, "What is Bacillus Languor? And
          no grandiloquent words, GRANNI."<br />
          You hear whirring as GRANNI searches her database. Soon she reads,
          <code>
            "Bacillus Languor is a sickness that causes severe vomiting and has
            a 87.4% fatality rate. It was eradicated in 2091 AD and was
            sequenced in 2084 AD after it became a pandemic. The only known cure
            is the skin of a Macaya Breast-spot Frog combined with ocean
            sediment, used within 96 hours of the first symptoms. Due to this
            miraculous ability, the frogs were soon hunted to extinction. The
            only remaining skins left are in some medkits that were produced
            before 2102." </code
          ><br />
          After you hear this, you realize that the medkits in the Hecate-1 are
          all from 2120 or later. You think that the first moon bases were from
          around 2089, so some of the older ones may have the Macaya Breast-spot
          Frog's skin and ocean sediment. You decide that you have to venture
          out and find one of the other settlements, possibly the French or
          German settlements. Now, do you want to ask the adults and have them
          consider it or do you want to just go without telling anyone?<br />

          many ways and safer for you to go. Both your parents object, but you
